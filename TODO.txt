[X] Grid Class
    [X] Visualize Grid
    [X] Extraction point
    [X] pass in coordinates for agents, ghost


[x] Start Baseline
    [x] understand setup for PyMARL
    [x] implement checking available agent actions
    [x] make extraction area big
    [] move env params from constants file to env yaml file
    [x] reduce time to kill
    [] reward structure
        [x]reward for getting ghost closer to extraction area
    [x] make ghost movement less erratic, easier to herd
    [] randomize agent starting positions

[] Add Partial Observability
    [] ensure vision works for agents
    [] start modelling ghost location probabilities
    [] visualize ghost location probabilities
    [] train this model
